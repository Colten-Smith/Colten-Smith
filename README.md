When I was little, and I mean really little, I loved playing with what were called Tinker-Toys. Using these wooden building blocks, I'd try to come up with little "inventions" to solve problems around the house. Building creative solutions to solve problems has been a passion of mine since I was literally learning to walk, and I show no signs of stopping. 
As a software engineer with experience in Python and C#, I can re-ignite that passion for creation that I've had since childhood and let in burn brighter than ever before. 
But every fire needs fuel, and the fuel of creation is experience. Any opportunity to get more experience is a chance to fuel that fire, so I'm always on the lookout to try new things. If you are willing to give me that opportunity, please do not hesitate to get in contact with me.
